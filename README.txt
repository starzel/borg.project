borg.project Package Readme
===========================

Overview
--------

borg.project adds the ability to create project workspaces with local workflow
policies and local roles.

borg.project is known to work with Plone 3.2, Plone 3.3 and the latest
Plone 4.0 Beta.

One can use it to create a workspace for projects that only certain members
can access and modify and where you can decide to use other workflows for
the content than in the rest of the portal.
All these settings are configured centrally on the project workspace
itself.
