- There is an issue with permission settings and Files if somebody uses
  plone.app.blob. Because Plone.app.blob adds a new content type that
  uses the same add permission like another one. If you allow adding only
  one of the two types, the resulting permissions are unpredictable.
  Also, as one of the type has global_allow set to False, you can not even
  add that to the project allowed content types, because we filter for that.
  Discussion is under way
